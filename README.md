<h1> Audio Denoising </h1>
-- Deep Learning for Signal Processing --


<h2> Introduction</h2>

Audio signals can be distorted due to various sources, from background noises to reverberations or multiple speakers, all leading to degraded speech intelligibility. This makes audio denoising a major problem in the field.

In this project, we address this issue by implementing and testing some of the algorithms used nowadays and discussing their efficiency and performance. We mainly focus on two approaches: the first one involves working on the spectrograms of the signals by implementing a denoising Unet, and the second approach involves working with the time-domain signal by performing some preprocessing and implementing a Wave Unet designed for this purpose. In the end, we compare the results obtained from our different training methods and discuss the effectiveness or lack thereof of some methods.

Additionnally, we will present some classical algorithms, as alternatives to the deep learning approaches.
